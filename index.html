		<h3 id="introduction">Welcome traveler!</h3>
		<p>Nice to meet you, I am Annika, MSc graduate, ICT designer, hobbyist coder (Python, JS, html, CSS), and a
			(digital) service & UX/UI design enthusiast with a knack for visuals and graphics stuff. Passionate about
			pleasant visuals and user friendly design.<br>
			Welcome to my online portfolio! Please note that this portfolio is still a work in progress!</p>

			<h3 id="figma">Figma</h3>
			<p>I have gotten familiar in using Figma through personal projects as well as some work related projects. Below
				you can find an example of a little adventure mobile game I designed and prototyped with using only Figma.
				Please give it a go!</p>
			<p>While working with Smart AG Finland team, I got to use Figma to create a working prototype of an UI for their
				new product to their ISOBUS system. I learned a lot about mostly prototyping and how to use button
				variants as well as the most important features available in Figma. For example, creating and using 
				components and masters, the pen tool, and how to effectively change small details in my project to make it more user friendly. 
				Both of these projects have taught me a lot about the everyday use of Figma and its strengths in UI
				design.</p>

			<h3 id="coding">Coding Experience</h3>
				<p>My journey with coding started during my Master's level studies and a mandatory introduction to coding course. The course was an online course provided by Helsinki University. 
				The course taught us the basics of Python programming language and consisted of multiple programming exercises and an exam. I finished the course with the best grade possible.</p>
				<p>A year after learning the basics of Python I applied to become a teacher for a kids' coding camp provided by <a href="https://kodarit.fi">Koodikaverit Oy</a>. After teaching the 
					week long coding camp for beginner level coders I continued teaching coding as a part time job one evening a week. June of 2023 marks my two-year anniversary working with Koodikaverit.</p> 
				<p>Over the two years I have taught multiple level 1 (including mainly Scratch projects and other visual coding exercises) courses, and three level 2 (moving on to simple Python exercises 
					and getting familiar with Python syntax as well as finishing with a simple html & Javascript exercise.) courses. All of the courses outside of Summer camps are taught as hybrid courses, 
					where some students are with me in person and some are online through Zoom. I have also taught fully remote vcourses through Zoom.</p> 
				<p>More experienced courses (including more advanced html, css and JavaScript projects, and eventually moving on to Unity and C# projects.) I have taught as an assistant teacher so, that 
					a part of the students are in person with me and the actual teacher is teaching through Zoom with other students present on their end as well as some students participating fully remotely.</p>
				<p>I encourage you to take a look at the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/twrd/">Scratch</a> projects I have taught as well as my <a href="https://replit.com/@twrd">Replit</a> account 
				   for the more advanced projects we have done with the students.</p>

		<h3 id="smartentry">Service Design competition by KIRAHub and Naantali Housing Fair</h3>
		<p>In the Summer of 2022 KIRAHub in cooperation with the Naantali housing fair 
			launched a Service Design
			competition with the question of "What could digi be?".The 
			goal of the competition was to come up what kind of smart 
			home solutions there could be a market for in the future.</p>
		<p> I joined a team of 4 Service Design professionals and 
			together we came up with the concept "SmartEntry". The 
			concept was future's smart entrance hall solution for 	
			families with kids to ease the everyday comings and goings 
			of the family.</p> 
		<p> Our solution received an honorary mention 
			from the panel of judges for its "user-centric approach", 
			"real life feeling possible use scenarios", and 
			"sympathetic presentation". More information can be found 
			from <a href="https://tiedesign.fi/smartentry/">Tie Design's webpage</a> (in Finnish only).</p>
